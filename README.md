# Reveal.js Template

* `demo.html` - The original Reveal demo file, showing off what Reveal can do.
* `css`, `js`, `lib`, `plugin` - Contains Reveal.js code.  Do not modify unless you're updating Reveal itself.

* `index.html` - Sample showing off the theme.
* `assets` - Directory for all per-slide deck images and videos.
* `platform` - Contains Platform-specific theme and branding.


The theme has been setup specifically to be generically useful and not Platform specific... but supports body-class-based "skins" that add Platform-specific color schemes and fonts.  That makes it portable outside of Platform or reusable inside of Platform with equal ease.

I think it's decently documented for now, but feedback welcome.
